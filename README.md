# Goal of the project

The goal of the "HMI development" project is to build a board game type application using the Java language and the JavaFx graphic library. From a pedagogical point of view, this project makes it possible to put into practice the knowledge covered during the courses, with in particular the paradigm of MVC architecture (Model - View - Controller), object programming, unit testing, mathematics, etc. This project being transversal to the training, the expectations also bring into play subjects such as expression, English and economics-law.

In order to guarantee that the objectives and expected deliverables are respected, the subject is not free. The possible games are described in the next section. Their implementation will necessarily be done using game development frameworks, provided by the department, which come in two versions: one for games in text mode, and another for games in graphic mode using JavaFX. This framework makes it possible to respect a strict MVC architecture, and facilitates the implementation of unit tests. In addition, it provides most of the "mechanics" needed to create a board game, which allows the developer to focus on coding the rules of the chosen game, its visual representation and the decision algorithms to allow the computer to play.

In this regard, each project must allow play either with 2 human or computer players, or with 1 human and 1 computer. Moreover, when a player is the computer, he must be able to apply at least 2 different strategies to make his game decisions. More details are indicated in the specifications section.
